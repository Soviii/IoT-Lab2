## Overview of Lab 2
The purpose of lab 2 is to simulate a traffic light system through different colored lights along with the functionality for assisting the visually impaired. There are 4 states: a red state, a red-yellow state, a yellow state, and a green state. From a red state, it will proceed in the following order: red -> red-yellow -> green. From a green state, it will proceed in the following order: green -> yellow -> red. There are various buzzer procedures for when the state is red and green. To change the current state of the traffic light, the current state must be green and the button must be pressed to commence the seqeuence mentioned previously.
